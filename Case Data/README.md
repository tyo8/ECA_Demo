# Case Data

Case Data is a MATLAB datafile repository that holds the data cited in **ref**.

Each MATLAB file "Case_#.mat" contains all of the variables necessary to run the full simulation and reconstruction pipelines.

Instructions for running simulation and reconstruction code on the given variables may be found in **Algorithms_and_data_structures.pdf**

## Computational Resources

The datasets in this folder were designed to run the reconstruction algorithm on a supercomputing cluster. We recommend that your system have at least 250GB of RAM available to replicate our tests of this reconstruction algorithm.

## Usage

The datasets in this folder are provided for transparency and reproducibility. They may not be used for other purposes without the explicit permission of the authors.
